# NAICS6 Classification Challenge

## Overview
This project aims to tackle the challenge of NAICS6 classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a keyword-based algorithm. The goal is to classify businesses into specific industry categories based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes at the 6-digit level.

## Problem Statement
The NAICS6 classification task involves assigning a 6-digit NAICS code to each business based on its primary activities and industry sector. In this project, we will leverage NLP methods and a keyword-based algorithm to achieve this task.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of business records with associated NAICS codes. Each record includes information such as company name, industry description, and other relevant features. The dataset is sourced from [insert source].

## Approach
The classification task will be approached using the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Text data preprocessing techniques will be applied to clean and prepare the textual features for classification.
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Keywords relevant to each NAICS category will be extracted using NLP methods such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.
3. **Keyword-Based Classification**: A keyword-based algorithm will be developed to classify businesses based on the presence of relevant keywords in their descriptions.
